# Title: Voice Recognition to Determine Emotions

![](images/loudspeaker.png | width=50%)

## Project Description

We havve seen the use of Neural Networks (NNs) in many different voice recoginition programs, namely speech-to-text, voice and echo cancellation, and voice commands with internet of things devices. Perhaps with the use of NNs, we can take advice of voice recognition to predict the emotional state of the person behind the voice from a sample of voices.

In this project, the intention is to use train a NN model to recognize speech and identify different tones and and correlate them to different human emotions. From that, the goal is to identify potental emotions from the voice with varying levels of accuracy.

## Project Goals

1. Create a NN model to recognize voice.
2. Train our NN model to identify certain patterns in the voice that correlate to different tones and predict the emotion.
3. Provide an accuracy chart of a range of emotions for each voice sample.
