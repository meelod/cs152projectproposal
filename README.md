# Voice Recognition to Determine Tone

## Project Description

We havve seen the use of Neural Networks (NNs) in many different voice recoginition programs, namely speech-to-text, voice and echo cancellation, and voice commands with internet of things devices. Perhaps with the use of NNs, we can take advice of voice recognition to predict the tone of the person behind the voice from a sample of voices.

In this project, the intention is to use train a NN model to recognize speech and identify different patterns and and correlate them to different tones. From that, the goal is to identify potental tones from the voice with varying levels of accuracy.

## Project Goals

1. Create a NN model to recognize voice.
2. Train our NN model to identify certain patterns in the voice that correlate to different tones and make predictions for future samples.
3. Provide an accuracy chart of a range of tones for each voice sample.
